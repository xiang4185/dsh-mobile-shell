 * fix-spm-vendor — re-apply the vendored local-path dependency after
 * `cap sync ios`. Capacitor CLI regenerates CapApp-SPM/Package.swift on every
 * sync ("DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE"), silently reverting the offline
 * `.package(path:)` edit back to the github.com remote (ADR-0005). This
 * script restores the vendored declaration so builds stay offline.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/fix-spm-vendor.mjs   (run from anywhere; idempotent)
